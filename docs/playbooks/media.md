## What this subsystem is

The **finished-reel spine** (D8): script → art-direction → storyboard → generate → voiceover →
assemble → captions. The deliverable is **ONE mp4**, not a bag of clips.

The storyboard is a **BLOCK DECK**: N blocks, every block the same length, each carrying exactly one
narration line. `packages/core/src/storyboard.ts` parses it; `packages/cost/src/media.ts` prices the
whole job before a request exists.

## Invariants — what must never break

- **The price table is keyed by the billing unit the vendor actually charges on.** A media line item
  MUST be priced per **submitted input** — characters, megapixels, video-seconds, input audio-minutes.
  **A model billed per GENERATED output duration, or per COMPUTE second, cannot be reserved and is
  therefore REFUSED by construction.** The whole job is reserved before any request exists, so a
  guess-vs-submit gap there is the money bug in a new costume. This is why
  `fal-ai/elevenlabs/…/scribe-v2` (input audio minute) is in and `fal-ai/whisper` (compute second) is
  out — not because whisper is expensive, but because it is unreservable. *"Cheap in practice"* is
  exactly the reasoning ADR-011 exists to forbid.
- **A resolution missing from a model's row is `unknown_model`** — never a fallback to another tier.
  A fallback would price a 1080p submit at the 480p row and under-report by 3×.
- **The adapter pins `model`, `resolution`, `duration`, the audio flag and the TTS sample rate
  EXPLICITLY on every submit.** Never rely on a fal default. **Wan 2.5's default is 1080p**, so an
  estimate computed at 480p against a submit that omits `resolution` under-reports by **3×**.
- **Wan 2.5 accepts `duration` of 5 or 10 seconds ONLY.** There is no 15 s.
- **Blocks are fixed-length and uniform** (D8). A clip shorter than its window is a HARD ERROR, never
  a held still frame. **No time-stretch, ever** — no `atempo`, no `setpts`, no TTS `speed`. A test in
  `media.test.ts` greps for those tokens.
- **The JOB is the priced and reserved unit** — not the shot, not the clip.
- **The cents floor is applied ONCE, on the batch total** (D12a). Never per line item: a 6-block
  reel's true $0.012 voice cost becomes $0.06 that way — a 5× over-reservation that compounds on
  longer decks.
- **A narration line has a BAND, not a ceiling, and the band travels with the block length:**
  `minCharsFor(clipSeconds)`–`maxCharsFor(clipSeconds)` — **103–140 at 10 s, 43–70 at 5 s.**
  `MAX_CHARS_PER_BLOCK = 140` is only the 10-second ceiling and the number the skill body teaches.
  `assemble_final.sh` hard-errors on a take whose speech falls OUTSIDE
  `[clipSeconds - 1.4, clipSeconds]` seconds — **too short is as fatal as too long**, and both land
  after the clips are paid for. Two holes lived here: a flat 140 passed a 120-character line in a
  5-second deck, and no floor at all passed a pithy 46-character line in a 10-second one. The floor
  is computed at the SLOWEST plausible delivery (12 chars/s) on purpose, so it only refuses a line
  that cannot fill its window at any pace — measured pace wanders 1.9–3.4 words/second between
  generations of the same line.
- A narration line outside the band is refused at storyboard parse,
  **before a cent is spent**. The provider returns no duration (delta §1.5), so the overrun is
  otherwise only measurable by `ffprobe` in the sandbox — after ~$3.00 of clips have been paid for.
- **No fal URL is ever written to any row or any audit payload** (§4).

## Rate observation (dated, vendor-direct)

Read from fal's own catalog API on **2026-08-02** —
`GET https://fal.ai/api/models?keywords=…`, unauthenticated and machine-readable. Verbatim vendor
strings are pinned in `packages/cost/src/media.fixtures.json` and a test asserts the table agrees
with them.

| Model | Rate | Billing unit | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fal-ai/wan-25-preview/text-to-video` | 480p $0.05/s · 720p $0.10/s · **1080p $0.15/s** | video-second. **1080p is fal's DEFAULT.** `duration` ∈ {5,10} only | **HIGH** — vendor `pricingInfoOverride` |
| `fal-ai/flux/schnell` | $0.003 per WHOLE megapixel | megapixel, rounded UP | **MEDIUM** — see below |
| `fal-ai/inworld-tts` | $0.01 per 1000 characters | **submitted** characters — fractional, NOT rounded up | **HIGH** — vendor `pricingInfoOverride` |
| `fal-ai/elevenlabs/speech-to-text/scribe-v2` | $0.008 per input audio minute | input audio minute | **HIGH** — vendor `pricingInfoOverride` |
| Vercel Sandbox render | flat `$0.02` estimate | per render — a named constant, not metered | estimate (delta §2.5) |

Three things the 2026-08-02 read established that the plan's table did not say:

1. **`fal-ai/wan-25-preview/text-to-video` is live**: `deprecated: false`, `removed: false`,
   `status: "public"`. The `-preview` rename risk has NOT fired. Its `image-to-video` sibling carries
   an identical rate string.
2. **scribe-v2 has a surcharge**: *"If keyterm is used, you request will cost %30 more."* We do not
   send keyterms, and must not start without re-pricing — $0.008 → $0.0104/min.
3. **FLUX schnell's per-megapixel RATE is not vendor-confirmed.** Its catalog entry exposes only
   `billingMessage: "Images are billed by rounding up to the nearest megapixel"` and **no
   `pricingInfoOverride`**. The rounding RULE is vendor-direct; the **$0.003 figure is secondary-
   sourced** and stays MEDIUM until an invoice reconciles it. Both `fal-ai/flux/schnell` and
   `fal-ai/flux-1/schnell` exist and both carry the same billing message.

## The §4.1 job economics

The **worst legal case**: 6 paid blocks at 480p × 10 s, every narration at the band ceiling
(`maxCharsFor(10)` = 140 chars), with captions.

| Line | Cost |
|---|---|
| 6 × 480p × 10 s clips | $3.0000 |
| voice — 6 × 140 chars, reserved at **2×** (840 chars → 1,680 submitted) | $0.0168 |
| captions STT (1 min) | $0.0080 |
| render (sandbox) | $0.0200 |
| **Total** | **$3.0448 → 305 cents** |

Against `MEDIA_JOB_CAP_USD = $3.50` — **13% headroom**.

> **Corrected 2026-08-02 (20-04).** This table previously read `voice (~1,200 chars) $0.012` +
> `voice retry allowance $0.012`, total **$3.052 → 306 cents**. That 1,200 is **not reachable**: it
> is 200 characters per block, and 20-13's narration BAND caps a 10-second block at **140**. Six
> blocks hold at most 840 characters, so the largest legal 6-block job is **$3.0448 → 305 cents**,
> and `media.test.ts` pins that number. The old figure was an estimate written before the band
> existed; nothing regressed, the ceiling simply got tighter. The retry allowance is unchanged in
> substance — it is the `× 2` on the voice line, not a separate row.

**The cap is bounded by the CLIPS.** TTS is 0.55% of the job and is not a threat to it. That is why
D10's arithmetic refuses 6 blocks at 720p ($6.00+) and 12 blocks at 480p ($6.00+), and why **the
budget rail is also the render-duration rail**: the sandbox never sees a resolution whose encode time
would change delta §2.4's numbers. Both refusals are pinned in `media.test.ts`.

## The budget rail (20-04)

Media draws its **own** named daily windows. They are appended to the ONE `RateLimiter` in
`packages/backend/convex/guardrails.ts` — a second limiter instance would be a second component
mount for zero gain.

| Window | Rate | Keyed by |
|---|---|---|
| `mediaSpendCents` | `MEDIA_DAILY_BUDGET_CENTS` = **1,000** ($10/day) | `tenantId` |
| `deploymentMediaSpendCents` | `DEPLOYMENT_MEDIA_BUDGET_CENTS` = **10,000** ($100/day) | **KEYLESS** |

`DEPLOYMENT_MEDIA_BUDGET_CENTS` resolves research Open Question 2. D10 names only the per-tenant
number; the ceiling is a planning decision, and 22.1-02's argument applies unchanged — per-tenant
keying alone makes exposure `N × $10`, unbounded in N, with the manual kill switch as the only
global stop. **10,000 keeps the same 10× ratio `DEPLOYMENT_BUDGET_CENTS` holds over
`DAILY_BUDGET_CENTS`** — one ratio to remember across both rails. Worst-case daily exposure is
therefore **$100 media + $50 LLM, across four windows that never share.**

### Invariants

- **Media spend NEVER moves the token budget, in either direction.** ADR-011 and D10 both say the
  rails do not share a window, and `dispatch.ts`'s `ENVELOPE_FRACTION` takes its 25% out of the LLM
  rail specifically — folding media in would silently shrink every sub-agent envelope. Asserted both
  ways in `media.test.ts`.
- **The whole JOB is reserved BEFORE the first POST.** `media.reserveJob` estimates every line
  (clips + voice + captions STT + render), refuses over `MEDIA_JOB_CAP_USD`, `check`s both windows
  and consumes them with `reserve: true` — **all inside one mutation, which is one serializable
  transaction.** This is the ONE place media diverges from the LLM rail: `prepare`/`recordSpend` can
  safely check-then-record-later because LLM calls in a turn are serial and an overshoot is cents.
  Here 13+ jobs are submitted back-to-back and land minutes apart, so post-hoc recording would let
  all of them fire against a window that had room for one. *An LLM overshoot is cents, a media
  overshoot is dollars* (20-PROVIDER-EVAL.md §4).
- **A refused job inserts ZERO `mediaJobs` rows.** All-or-nothing by construction, not by cleanup —
  every refusal returns before the first `ctx.db.insert`.
- **The cents floor is applied ONCE, on the job total**, by `chooseMediaBatch`. Per-line `estUsd`
  goes onto the rows unfloored.
- **The voice line is reserved at 2× its character estimate** so one rewrite round is already paid
  for. The provider returns no duration, so an overrunning line is only provable in the sandbox, and
  the cure is a rewrite plus a re-voice — a job that cannot afford its own cure would strand a paid
  deck.
- **The render is a reserved cost line with NO `mediaJobs` row.** It has no `falRequestId` and no
  webhook; it is a plan-row concern. It is reserved so a job that cannot afford its own render is
  refused before its clips are bought.
- **No refunds.** If 3 of 6 blocks come back `provider_blocked`, the reserved cents stay consumed.
  Over-reservation is the fail-closed bias. Refunding turns a rate-limiter window into a ledger; the
  upgrade path, if drift ever proves material, is a real spend table — not a credit call.
- **Regenerate-one-block is a job of ONE block through the identical path** (one video line, one tts
  line, one render line — regenerating a block invalidates the reel and forces a re-render). No
  second rail, no second cap, no bypass.

### The two kill switches — INDEPENDENT levers

```bash
# from packages/backend — the convex CLI only resolves the deployment from there
npx convex run guardrails:setKillSwitch      '{"on":true}'   # stops EVERYTHING incl. media
npx convex run guardrails:setMediaKillSwitch '{"on":true}'   # stops paid generation ONLY
```

Flipping the LLM kill switch must not be the only way to pause media, and pausing media must not
pause the email cockpit — that is the point of a separate rail. But `reserveJob` checks **both**: an
all-stop is an all-stop. `mediaKillSwitch` is `v.optional` in the schema, so a row written before
Phase 20 reads OFF by the same default-on-read the main switch uses. Zero seed, zero migration.

Read remaining budget without consuming it: `guardrails:mediaRemainingCents` (the tighter of the two
rails, each clamped `>= 0` first — `reserve: true` can drive a window negative).

### The refusal codes

`kill_switch` · `unknown_model` · `over_job_cap` · `illegal_duration` · `narration_too_long` ·
`narration_too_short` · `media_daily_exhausted` · `deployment_media_exhausted`

They are distinct because they send the user to distinct levers: rewrite a line, cut blocks, wait
for tomorrow, or call the operator. `unknown_model` is the one that fires on the `-preview` rename
risk below — loud, free, and fail-closed.

### Mutation checks — observed RED on demand, 2026-08-02

The guarantees below were each **seen to fail**, not merely asserted. Restored byte-identical after
every one.

| Mutation applied | What actually fired |
|---|---|
| `rateLimiter.limit(...)` removed from `reserveJobInner` (consumption outside the transaction) | **7 of 22 tests RED**, incl. the concurrency test — no window moved at all |
| the tenant `check` sized `count: 1` instead of `count: estCents` (the `preCall` shape) | concurrency test RED on the target line: **`expected [ {…}, {…} ] to have a length of 1 but got 2`** — both jobs won |
| the cents floor moved from the batch total to per-line | **6 RED**: the 13-line sub-cent job `expected 15 to be 4`; the §4.1 job `expected 309 to be 305` |
| the narration band pre-flight guard deleted | **3 RED**, and each returned a 5-key `ok: true` object — i.e. **the over-length job reached a reservation. Money moved.** That second half is the point of the guard |

### Known gap — `guardrails.ts` is in NO playbook's watch prefix

Research §11.3 recorded it and it is still true: `packages/backend/convex/guardrails.ts` appears in
no `watch.json` entry, so `check-playbooks` cannot demand a playbook bump when the spend rails
change. **20-04 deliberately did not fix it** — `guardrails.ts` is shared by the LLM rail and the
media rail, so assigning it to `media.md` alone would be wrong, and assigning it needs an owner
decision about which playbook holds the guard subsystem.

## The assemble contract (20-13)

`packages/backend/convex/render/assemble_final.sh` is the governed assembler, **harvested** from
the Higgsfield `faceless-channel-video` workflow v2.0 on 2026-08-02. Harvested, not cloned: the
contract and the ffmpeg invocations were taken; the workflow is not a dependency, and its MCP is
client-side only — structurally unreachable from a Convex action and from a Vercel Sandbox, which
is the finding ADR-011 exists to record.

### §5 DOES NOT APPLY TO THIS FILE

**CLAUDE.md §5 makes PROMPTS versioned `skills` rows. The obvious generalisation — "the assemble
script should be a registry row too" — is REMOTE CODE EXECUTION.** A registry row is mutable by a
database write, and this string is executed as a shell script inside a VM that holds tenant media.
The script is a repo file mirrored to a bundler-safe constant (`assembleScript.ts`) with a
byte-identity drift test, and `llmRedaction.test.ts` scans `skills.ts` to prove no `assemble` seed
entry and no `render/`-sourced body ever appears. Do not "fix" the mirror into a registry row.

### The five inherited properties, and the failure each one encodes

| Property | The failure it prevents |
|---|---|
| **Fixed length `N × clip-seconds`**, asserted on the OUTPUT to ±1s | a video silently shortened to fit its audio |
| **No time-stretch, ever** — no `atempo`, no `setpts`, no speech trimming | an overrunning line rate-shifted into the window; audible, and no downstream test would catch it. An overrun is a HARD ERROR to be rewritten upstream |
| **A clip shorter than its window by >0.5s is a HARD ERROR** | a held still frame passed off as a scene |
| **Speech-centred, not file-centred** (lead/trail silence measured by `silencedetect` and ignored) | a padded TTS take shifting the words off their scene |
| **Narration in every window**, asserted on the joined track before finalisation | the "silent second half" failure of every hand-rolled assembly |

Also inherited: per-input voice loudnorm (a fresh TTS take lands near −31 dB while dialogue lifted
out of a generated clip lands near −21 dB — mixing both at 1.0 is the "narrator quiet, character
loud" complaint), two-pass **linear** loudnorm at −16 LUFS on the final, and full-decode validation.

### The sidecar field set AS HARVESTED

**`packages/core/src/assembly.ts` is the SOURCE OF TRUTH for these names from here on.** The
validator maps snake_case in → camelCase out in one place, so a field-name correction is a one-file
change.

Top level: `script` · `out` · `block_count` · `clip_seconds` · `total_duration_s` ·
`actual_duration_s` · `width` · `height` · `fps` · `sfx_vol` · `gates[]` · `blocks[]` · `ts`
Per block: `block_index` (0-based) · `window_start_s` · `lead_silence_s` · `speech_abs_s` ·
`speech_dur_s` · `clip_dur_s` · `overrun` · `internal_pauses` · `freeze_head` · `freeze_tail`

The captions rebase is why the two anchors exist, and it is one line:
`absolute_t = speech_abs_s + (word_t_in_clean_take - lead_silence_s)`

### An invalid sidecar means the reel is NOT published

This is an invariant, not a preference. D8: *"a final video without one was hand-assembled."* An
invalid sidecar is not "render with a warning" — the job fails with a code and nothing is published
(plan 20-16 enforces it). A sidecar reporting `overrun: true` on any block is INVALID: it is
reporting a failed render, not a rendered failure.

### Deferred, and re-adding either is a scope decision

`--music` (ducked bed) and `--song` (music-video mode) are stripped, along with `--stepped`, the
poster frame, and the `--manifest`/`--allow-mismatch` pair plumbing that index discovery replaces.
`assembleScript.test.ts` scans for all three flags, so re-adding one is a visible decision rather
than a quiet drift.

## Storage retention (D12b)

~55 MB/job × 2 jobs/day = **3.3 GB/month** against a Convex Free/Starter allowance of **1 GB**. On a
successful render with a valid sidecar, the intermediate clips and voice takes are
`ctx.storage.delete()`d; **on FAILURE they are KEPT as debugging evidence**. Plan 20-16 implements it.

## Dependencies & blast radius

`fal-ai/wan-25-preview/…` is a **`-preview` endpoint**. Preview paths get renamed and retired, and a
rename turns every generation into `unknown_model` — which is the *correct* failure (loud, free) but
reads to a user as a broken feature.

**Detection is free:** one unauthenticated `GET https://fal.ai/api/models?keywords=…` returns
`deprecated` / `removed` / `status` per model. Replicate is ADR-011's recorded fallback.

## Reconciliation

The D5 procedure. Two bullets, both runnable, both $0. Cadence: **at each phase close, and any time
a price row is edited.** **Plan 20-11's owner-run live gate IS this procedure's first run.**

**(a) Did we charge what we reserved?** Sum `mediaJobs.actualCents` for a period and compare against
fal's own dashboard balance delta for the same period:

```bash
# from packages/backend — the convex CLI only resolves the deployment from there
npx convex run media:spendForPeriod '{"sinceMs": 1754006400000, "untilMs": 1754611200000}'
```

Compare the returned `actualCents` total against fal's billing page for the same window. A gap
means the table is wrong, not that the meter is wrong — the meter records what the provider
reported.

> ⚠️ **`media:spendForPeriod` DOES NOT EXIST, and no plan owns it (found 2026-08-02 by 20-04).**
> This paragraph said it "lands with plan 20-04". It does not: 20-04 ships only `reserveJob` +
> `reserveJobInner`, and a grep across all seventeen Phase-20 plans finds no plan that authors this
> query or `media:listJobs` either. `mediaJobs.actualCents` is written by the webhook path (20-06),
> so **the reader is the missing half of the D5 procedure**. The natural home is 20-11, whose
> owner-run live gate this playbook already calls "this procedure's first run" — but that is an
> assignment nobody has made. Until then, reconcile by reading rows directly in the dashboard or via
> `npx convex run` against a `by_plan`/`by_batch` index query.

**(b) Is the price table still the vendor's price?** Re-read fal's catalog API and diff it against
the committed fixture:

```bash
curl -s "https://fal.ai/api/models?keywords=wan-25&page=1" \
  | node -e "const j=JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync(0));for(const m of j.items)console.log(m.id,'|',m.status,'| deprecated:',m.deprecated,'| removed:',m.removed,'|',m.pricingInfoOverride)"
# repeat for keywords=inworld, keywords=scribe, keywords=schnell
# then diff the printed strings against packages/cost/src/media.fixtures.json
```

This is unauthenticated and free, and it is **also the endpoint-health check**: the same response
carries `deprecated` / `removed` / `status`, which is the detection mechanism for the `-preview`
rename risk below. Any change is a one-line table edit plus a fixture update — and
`media.test.ts` fails until the two agree, so the edit cannot land half-done.

**Known open item from the 2026-08-02 read:** FLUX schnell's **$0.003/megapixel is MEDIUM
confidence** — the vendor publishes the rounding rule but no price string. The first invoice that
includes an image generation resolves it.

## How to change this safely

- A rate edit is a one-line table change **plus** a `media.fixtures.json` update from a fresh catalog
  read, so the diff shows the vendor string that justified it.
- Adding a model means answering ONE question first: *what does the vendor bill on?* If the answer is
  generated-output duration or compute seconds, the answer is no.

## Playbook ownership for Phase 20

Exactly **ONE plan per wave** may bump this file, so concurrent waves never contend for it:

20-01 (W1) · 20-13 (W2) · 20-04 (W3) · 20-05 (W4) · 20-06 (W5) · [W6 none — 20-07 owns `cockpit.md`] ·
20-14 (W7) · 20-15 (W8) · 20-09 (W9) · 20-16 (W10) · 20-10 (W11) · 20-17 (W12) · 20-11 (W13).

This is why the wave graph is longer than the dependency graph alone requires.

<!-- ponytail: watch.json registers PRODUCTION paths only, deliberately NOT the `.test.ts` siblings.
     Test files are exempt from check-playbooks' creation gap, and registering them would force every
     plan in this phase that touches a media test to bump this playbook — serialising waves that share
     nothing else. If check-playbooks ever blocks on a `.test.ts` creation anyway, the fix is to add
     that ONE path, not to abandon the split.
     `apps/web/app/(app)/dashboard/workspace/MediaCanvas.tsx` is registered as a single FILE, not via
     its directory: `cockpit.md` already claims that directory, and a change to MediaCanvas.tsx should
     demand BOTH playbooks — it is a cockpit surface and a media surface at once. -->
